R-STDP for Spiking Neural Networks Trained to Perform Sound Localization

Modeling Divisive Normalization in the Central Auditory Pathway with Convolutional Neural Networks
------
![div-norm-cnn](/images/div-norm-cnn.png)

I implemented local divisive normalization in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) modeling the central auditory pathway. This work aims to provide novel insights for whether divisive normalization properties observed in biological systems might emerge from task optimization and whether CNNs with divisive normalization could be used to study hearing impairment.

This project was done as part of the [MIT Summer Research Program in Neuroscience](https://bcs.mit.edu/msrp) in MIT's [Laboratory for Computational Audition](https://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/) during the summer of 2023.

Cross-Organizational Continual Learning of Cyber Threat Models
------
![continual-learning](/images/continual-learning.png)

I developed an end-to-end continual learning system for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that learned from an online data stream of network traffic. This work aimed to enable continual learning from cross-organizational (cross-network) streams of data over time and further employed active learning techniques to reduce the amount of labeled data required.

High Power Microwave Parameter Sensitivity Analysis Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques
------

![active-learning](/images/active-learning.png)

I designed active learning surrogate models that could optimize high power microwave device parameters, reducing computational cost and time needed to simulate and design each device. An interactive query system was introduced for obtaining human labels for model predictions that had high uncertainty.

This project was done as part of the [Air Force Research Laboratory Scholars Program](https://afrlscholars.usra.edu) during the summer and fall of 2021.
