I am a BSc student in RIT's Neural Adaptive Computing Laboratory working with Dr. Alexander Ororbia II to develop spiking neural network models of human-level decision making. I am concurrently working with Dr. Josh McDermott as a visiting student in MIT's Laboratory for Computational Audition. There, I am focused on developing more biologically plausible models of human hearing.
